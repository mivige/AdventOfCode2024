# Advent of Code 2024 🎄🌟

## Challenge Background
This year's Advent of Code challenge follows an intriguing mystery: the Chief Historian has gone missing while exploring historically significant locations for the North Pole. As a key assistant to the Senior Historians, the mission is to help locate the Chief Historian by solving puzzles and collecting stars.

## Challenge Goal
- Collect 50 stars before Santa's departure on December 25th
- Solve two puzzles per day
- Unlock the second puzzle of each day by completing the first

## Repository Structure
- Each day's solutions will be organized in separate directories
- Code will be written in Python
- Includes both part 1 and part 2 solutions for each day's challenge
